# Reverse Proxy Server Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for building a reverse proxy server using Ktor. The reverse proxy will act as an intermediary for client requests, forwarding them to backend servers and returning responses to clients. It will include features such as load balancing, WebSocket support, circuit breaking, and security enhancements.

### 1.1 Key Features

- HTTP request forwarding
- Multiple load balancing strategies
- WebSocket support
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) support
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Security features (SSL/TLS, request filtering, rate limiting)
- Logging and monitoring

## 2. Architecture Design

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

```
Client → [Reverse Proxy Server] → Backend Servers
           ↓
         Logging & Monitoring
```

### 2.2 Key Components

1. **HTTP Server**: Ktor server to handle incoming client requests
2. **Load Balancer**: Component to distribute requests among backend servers
3. **Request Forwarder**: Component to forward HTTP requests to selected backend servers
4. **WebSocket Handler**: Component to handle WebSocket connections
5. **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience4j implementation to handle backend failures
6. **Security Layer**: Components for SSL termination, IP filtering, and rate limiting
7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Structured logging and metrics collection

### 2.3 Data Flow

1. Client sends request to the proxy server
2. Proxy server processes the request (authentication, validation, etc.)
3. Load balancer selects a backend server
4. Request is forwarded to the selected backend server
5. Response from backend server is returned to the client
6. All activities are logged for monitoring

## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Project Setup and Dependencies

1. Update the build.gradle.kts file to include additional dependencies:
   - Ktor client for making requests to backend servers
   - Ktor WebSockets for WebSocket support
   - Resilience4j for circuit breaker implementation
   - Additional security and monitoring libraries

2. Create a configuration file (application.conf or application.yaml) to define:
   - Backend server list
   - Load balancing strategy
   - Circuit breaker parameters
   - Security settings

### 3.2 Core Components Implementation

#### 3.2.1 HTTP Request Handling

1. Create a request handler to process incoming HTTP requests
2. Implement header processing (preserve/modify headers as needed)
3. Set up routing for different endpoints

#### 3.2.2 Load Balancing

1. Implement the following load balancing strategies:
   - Round-Robin
   - Random
   - Least Connections (optional)
   - Weighted (optional)
   - Consistent Hashing (optional)

2. Create a factory to select the appropriate strategy based on configuration

#### 3.2.3 Request Forwarding

1. Implement a request forwarder using Ktor client
2. Handle request transformation (headers, body, etc.)
3. Implement response handling and error management

#### 3.2.4 WebSocket Support

1. Set up WebSocket routes
2. Implement bidirectional frame forwarding
3. Handle WebSocket connection lifecycle

#### 3.2.5 Server-Sent Events (SSE) Support

1. Set up SSE routes
2. Implement event forwarding from backend to client
3. Handle SSE connection lifecycle
4. Implement reconnection mechanism

#### 3.2.6 Circuit Breaker Implementation

1. Integrate Resilience4j circuit breaker
2. Configure circuit breaker parameters
3. Implement fallback mechanisms for when the circuit is open
4. Add monitoring for circuit breaker state changes

### 3.3 Security Features

1. Implement SSL/TLS termination
2. Add IP filtering capabilities
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add request validation and sanitization

### 3.4 Logging and Monitoring

1. Set up structured logging with SLF4J and Logback
2. Implement request/response logging
3. Add performance metrics collection
4. Set up circuit breaker event logging

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Unit Testing

1. Test individual components:
   - Load balancing algorithms
   - Request transformation
   - Circuit breaker behavior
   - Security filters

### 4.2 Integration Testing

1. Test the complete request flow
2. Test WebSocket functionality
3. Test Server-Sent Events (SSE) functionality
4. Test circuit breaker with simulated backend failures
5. Test security features

### 4.3 Performance Testing

1. Test throughput and latency
2. Test under high load
3. Test circuit breaker behavior under stress

## 5. Deployment Considerations

### 5.1 Containerization

1. Create a Dockerfile for the application
2. Set up Docker Compose for local development with multiple backend services

### 5.2 Kubernetes Deployment (Optional)

1. Create Kubernetes manifests
2. Configure horizontal scaling
3. Set up health checks and readiness probes

### 5.3 Monitoring Setup

1. Configure logging aggregation
2. Set up metrics collection
3. Create dashboards for monitoring
