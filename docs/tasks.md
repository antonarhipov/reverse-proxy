3. [x] Set up routing for different endpoints

### 2.2 Load Balancing

1. [x] Implement load balancing strategies:
   1. [x] Round-Robin strategy
   2. [x] Random strategy
   3. [ ] Least Connections strategy (optional)
   4. [ ] Weighted strategy (optional)
   5. [ ] Consistent Hashing strategy (optional)

2. [x] Create a factory to select the appropriate strategy based on configuration

### 2.3 Request Forwarding

1. [x] Implement a request forwarder using Ktor client
2. [x] Handle request transformation (headers, body, etc.)
3. [x] Implement response handling and error management

### 2.4 WebSocket Support

1. [x] Set up WebSocket routes
2. [x] Implement bidirectional frame forwarding
3. [x] Handle WebSocket connection lifecycle

### 2.5 Server-Sent Events (SSE) Support

1. [x] Set up SSE routes
2. [x] Implement event forwarding from backend to client
3. [x] Handle SSE connection lifecycle
4. [x] Implement reconnection mechanism

### 2.6 Circuit Breaker Implementation

1. [x] Integrate Resilience4j circuit breaker
2. [x] Configure circuit breaker parameters
3. [x] Implement fallback mechanisms for when the circuit is open
4. [x] Add monitoring for circuit breaker state changes

## 3. Security Features

1. [x] Implement SSL/TLS termination
2. [x] Add IP filtering capabilities
3. [x] Implement rate limiting
4. [x] Add request validation and sanitization

## 4. Logging and Monitoring

1. [x] Set up structured logging with SLF4J and Logback
2. [x] Implement request/response logging
3. [x] Add performance metrics collection
4. [x] Set up circuit breaker event logging

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Unit Testing

1. [x] Test individual components:
   1. [x] Load balancing algorithms
   2. [x] Request transformation (Note: Complex to test due to Ktor dependencies)
   3. [x] Circuit breaker behavior
   4. [x] Security filters (Note: Complex to test due to Ktor dependencies)

### 5.2 Integration Testing

1. [x] Test the complete request flow
2. [x] Test WebSocket functionality
3. [x] Test Server-Sent Events (SSE) functionality
4. [x] Test circuit breaker with simulated backend failures
5. [x] Test security features

### 5.3 Performance Testing

1. [ ] Test throughput and latency
2. [ ] Test under high load
3. [ ] Test circuit breaker behavior under stress

## 6. Deployment Considerations

### 6.1 Containerization

1. [x] Create a Dockerfile for the application
2. [x] Set up Docker Compose for local development with multiple backend services

### 6.2 Monitoring Setup

1. [x] Configure logging aggregation
2. [x] Set up metrics collection
3. [x] Create dashboards for monitoring

## 7. Documentation and Finalization

1. [ ] Create user documentation
2. [ ] Create developer documentation
3. [ ] Perform final code review
4. [ ] Optimize performance based on testing results
