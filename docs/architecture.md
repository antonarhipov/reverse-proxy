# Reverse Proxy Architecture

## Overview

The Reverse Proxy Server is built using Kotlin and the Ktor framework. It acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers, providing features such as load balancing, circuit breaking, security, and more.

This document describes the high-level architecture of the Reverse Proxy Server, including its components, interactions, and data flow.

## System Architecture

The Reverse Proxy Server follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The main components are:

1. **HTTP Server**: Listens for incoming client requests
2. **Load Balancer**: Distributes requests among backend servers
3. **Request Forwarder**: Forwards HTTP requests to selected backend servers
4. **Circuit Breaker**: Monitors backend health and prevents cascading failures
5. **Security Layer**: Implements security features like SSL/TLS, IP filtering, and rate limiting
6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Captures request details and metrics for observability

## Component Interactions

### Request Flow

1. The client sends a request to the Reverse Proxy Server.
2. The Security Layer validates the request (IP filtering, rate limiting, etc.).
3. The Load Balancer selects a backend server based on the configured strategy.
4. The Circuit Breaker checks if the selected backend is healthy.
5. The Request Forwarder forwards the request to the selected backend server.
6. The backend server processes the request and returns a response.
7. The Request Forwarder forwards the response back to the client.
8. The Logging and Monitoring components record the request and response details.

### WebSocket Flow

1. The client initiates a WebSocket connection to the Reverse Proxy Server.
2. The Security Layer validates the connection request.
3. The Load Balancer selects a backend server.
4. The WebSocket Handler establishes a connection with the selected backend server.
5. The WebSocket Handler forwards frames bidirectionally between the client and the backend server.
6. The Logging and Monitoring components record connection events.

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) Flow

1. The client initiates an SSE connection to the Reverse Proxy Server.
2. The Security Layer validates the connection request.
3. The Load Balancer selects a backend server.
4. The SSE Handler establishes a connection with the selected backend server.
5. The SSE Handler forwards events from the backend server to the client.
6. The Logging and Monitoring components record connection events.

## Component Details

### HTTP Server

The HTTP Server is built using Ktor's Netty engine. It listens for incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate handlers based on the request path.

### Load Balancer

The Load Balancer distributes requests among multiple backend servers using various strategies:

- **Round-Robin**: Rotates sequentially through a list of backend servers
- **Random**: Randomly selects a backend server
- **Other strategies can be implemented by extending the LoadBalancer interface**

### Request Forwarder

The Request Forwarder is responsible for forwarding HTTP requests to the selected backend server and returning the response to the client. It handles:

- Copying request headers and body
- Adding X-Forwarded headers
- Handling response status, headers, and body

### Circuit Breaker

The Circuit Breaker monitors the health of backend servers and prevents cascading failures by:

- Tracking failure rates
- Opening the circuit when failure rates exceed thresholds
- Providing fallback responses when the circuit is open
- Allowing test requests when in half-open state

### Security Layer

The Security Layer implements various security features:

- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Handles HTTPS connections
- **IP Filtering**: Allows or blocks requests based on client IP
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting request rates
- **Request Validation**: Validates and sanitizes requests

### Logging and Monitoring

The Logging and Monitoring components provide observability:

- **Structured Logging**: Records request details, errors, and events
- **Metrics Collection**: Captures performance metrics
- **Circuit Breaker Events**: Logs state transitions and failures

## Configuration

The Reverse Proxy Server is configured using a YAML file that specifies:

- Backend server list
- Load balancing strategy
- Circuit breaker parameters
- Security settings
- WebSocket and SSE configuration

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for details.

## Extensibility

The Reverse Proxy Server is designed to be extensible:

- New load balancing strategies can be added by implementing the LoadBalancer interface
- Additional security features can be added by extending the SecurityHandler
- Custom metrics can be added to the MetricsHandler

See [Development](development.md) for details on extending the application.
